Both approaches have their advantages, but in the long run, clean code offers greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability."

        "text": "Clean code is code that is easy to read, understandable, well-structured, and free from unnecessary complexity. It adheres to principles like KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and SOLID. Such code simplifies testing, debugging, and further development."

          "Ease of maintenance and extension. Clean code allows you to quickly make changes and add new features without risking existing logic. This is especially important in rapidly changing requirements.",
          "Fewer bugs. A clear structure and lack of duplication reduce the likelihood of errors, making testing and debugging easier.",
          "Better team collaboration. When code follows common standards, other developers can easily understand the logic and contribute to the project.",
          "Scalability. Clean code is easier to adapt to new requirements and technologies, ensuring the long-term viability of the project."

          "Limited flexibility. Builders often do not allow for the implementation of complex logic or custom features.",
          "Scalability issues. As the project grows, builder-generated code can become difficult to maintain and expand.",
          "Platform dependence. Using a specific builder may tie you to a particular technology or provider."

        "heading": "Conclusion",
        "text": "While builders can be useful tools in certain scenarios, clean code remains the foundation of reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. Choosing clean code ensures greater flexibility, fewer errors, and better teamwork, ultimately leading to project success."
