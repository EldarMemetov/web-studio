Both approaches have their advantages, but in the long term, clean code offers greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability."

            "Ease of maintenance and extension. Clean code allows for quick changes and the addition of new features without risking breaking existing logic. This is especially important in the context of rapidly changing requirements.",
            "Reduction of errors. With clear structure and no duplication, the likelihood of errors is reduced, making testing and debugging easier.",
            "Better team collaboration. When code is written according to accepted standards, other developers can quickly understand its logic and easily contribute to the project.",
            "Scalability. Clean code is easier to adapt to new requirements and technologies, ensuring long-term project viability."

            "Limited flexibility. Builders often do not allow for implementing complex logic or custom features.",
            "Scalability issues. As a project grows, code created using a builder can become difficult to maintain and extend.",
